      <h2>1-on-1 coaching</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Brenda, one of the four creators of Doyenne. As a young working woman, I have gone through many of the same experiences as you probably have, which is why empowering other women is so important to me. I want all working women to believe in their own abilities, so they will have a good experience in the work field.
