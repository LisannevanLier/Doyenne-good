  <h2>Wire Frame Home Page</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-left">For our home page we wanted to have a banner which is also used on our social media pages. This way people recognize our brand. This banner shows woman standing strong together, while wearing shirts with our logo. Underneath the banner, the page will have three strong images of women with a header and a catchy text underneath. These will represent our courses. In this way the consumer can go directly to the services we are offering and find what they are looking for. For more information about the brand and what it stand for they can look at the menu options. </p>

        <h2>Color codes</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-left">The first color of our color palette is black. Black stands for power, fear and strength. We want to empower women who are afraid to stand up for themselves. With our brand we want to give them the strength to be more confident. The color also helps for boosting confidence and increasing the sense of potential and possibilities.
Next is white, this stands for safety, protection and perfection. With our brand we want to form a community, where woman feel safe and strong. A community which helps them grow and protects them. In addition, white represents a successful beginning. Our company is a successful beginning to grow as a business woman.  
Thirdly, the color pink. This stands for feminine. Our brand is made by women for women. The color is also associated with universal love of oneself and of others and represents friendship. Our community is full of love and accepting yourself.
Lastly, purple stands for ambition, power, pride, wealth and independence. All words a business woman can relate to. Purple uplifts spirits and calms the mind and nerves. It enhances the scared. We specifically choose light purple, because that represents feminine, energy and delicacy.</p>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-left">For the titles we used Permanent Marker, because it is a strong and clear font with a famine touch.  Next to this, we used Park Lane for the headings. This fits perfectly with permanent marker, because the fonts look like each other. For the normal text we wanted to have a clear font, but still something that represents power and strength. That is why we choose Times New Roman. </p>

        <h2>Description of user test method</h2>
        <p class="card-text">For our testing methods all team members tested two people who fit our target audience, so women between 25 and 34.  In total ten woman tested a digital prototype of our index and service page. The women did not know anything about our brand or website and were asked to give an opinion on the ease of use, what kind of brand the website stood for and what they were missing on the pages. First we let the testers figure out themselves how the pages worked on how the website was build. Then we asked them what the target audience of the pages was and what the brand could stand for. Lastly, we asked them if they were missing something. </p>

        <h2>Outcome of user testing and usability issues found</h2>
        <p class="card-text">During the tests on how to figure out how our website works and how the pages were functioning most woman found it very helpful that all the services were on the home page. Quoting some of the woman: “I would immediately know what you as brand have to offer by going to the website and landing on the home page”. “It draws my attention, especially if the icons are going to be relatable women.” When they clicked on the service they would go immediately to the explanation of the service which they found helpful. For the service page, the woman liked the button for “view all”. This helps them in comparing all the services. 
However, right away one of the women mentioned that she was missing contact information on the index page. That is why she suggested to put a link somewhere with contact or maybe add our social media links. 
When asked, what our target audience would be they immediately said woman. This is because of the banner and the colors of the brand. The women associated the pink and purple with strongness and connecting. However, they did not link right away that is was for business women, but that might be because they did not get the course information. 
The women thought the brand was for empowering either with makeup, hair or by connecting with the people. The last one is right, since we want to build a strong community for business women. 
Lastly, things that they felt were missing was a price list, and maybe to add consumer reviews.

        <h2>Recommendations for improvements based on user testing</h2>
        <p class="card-text">Things to improve based on our test was adding our social media and contact information on all the pages, but especially the home page. Next to this, the users recommended to use appealing pictures in the small circles on the home page. Pictures they could relate to. They found it important that they could relate to the brand and that this should also be represented in our vision and mission. The testers also recommended to add a price list and consumer reviews. This could be done later once the company already has a bit of success or once the company has sold a few courses. </p>
