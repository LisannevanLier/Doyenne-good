        <p class="card-text text-center">For our home page we wanted to have a banner which is also used on our social media pages. This way people recognize our brand. This banner shows woman standing strong together, while wearing shirts with our logo. Underneath the banner, the page will have three strong images of women with a header and a catchy text underneath. These will represent our courses.

        <h2 style="color:#ffaaad">Color codes</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-center">The first color of our color palette is black. Black stands for power, fear and strength. We want to empower women who are afraid to stand up for themselves. With our brand we want to give them the strength to be more confident. The color also helps for boosting confidence and increasing the sense of potential and possibilities.
Next is white, this stands for safety, protection and perfection. With our brand we want to form a community, where woman feel safe and strong. A community which helps them grow and protects them. In addition, white represents a successful beginning. Our company is a successful beginning to grow as a business woman.  
Thirdly, the color pink. This stands for feminine. Our brand is made by women for women. The color is also associated with universal love of oneself and of others and represents friendship. Our community is full of love and accepting yourself.
Lastly, purple stands for ambition, power, pride, wealth and independence. All words a business woman can relate to. Purple uplifts spirits and calms the mind and nerves. It enhances the scared. We specifically choose light purple, because that represents feminine, energy and delicacy.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#ffaaad">Fonts</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-center">For the titles we used Permanent Marker, because it is a strong and clear font with a famine touch.  Next to this, we used Park Lane for the headings. This fits perfectly with permanent marker, because the fonts look like each other. For the normal text we wanted to have a clear font, but still something that represents power and strength. That is why we choose Times New Roman. </p>

        <p class="card-text text-center">For our testing methods all team members send the link to people who fit our target audience, so women between 25 and 34.  In total six woman received our link and tested the website. We asked them to look at the website on their computer and on their phones. After that, they were asked to give feedback on all the pages. They were asked to point out all the mistakes or things that should be improved. Not only our target audience tested our website there were also three people who tested the website, who have knowledge about coding or do it as their job. </p>

        <h2 style="color:#ffaaad">Outcome of user testing and usability issues found</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-center">During our tests the testers found out that the Beyoncé picture on the index page is not working on mobile phones. It is not responsive and too big. However, the testers did found it very helpful to see on overview of all the services on the home page. The icons are attracting and they liked the lay-out and style of the page. Another critic point, is that the font is different if the people have not installed the adobe font. Lastly, our testers found some spelling mistakes on the page that still needs to be fixed.
On our vision page, other spelling mistakes were found and the text: “We live by our values” should be bold and bigger. Other than that they liked the slide show and the page gave them enough information about our company.
For the mission page, the testers would find it more clear if the text would be in a smaller box and the navigation bar was not working for mobile phone users. However, they did liked the video that was on the page, but the video is not too big for mobile screens.
On the service page, the testers found again spelling mistakes that should be fixed, but other than that it was a clear page. The links “learn more” were helpful and were sending the testers right away to our contact form. The users liked the clear overview of all the services we offer.
The creators page was perfect. There was no feedback there. They liked the descriptions of the owners from the company and the contact was clear. 
On the justification page they only discovered that again the navigation bar was not working for mobile phone users.

        <h2 style="color:#ffaaad">Recommendations for improvements based on user testing</h2>
        <p class="card-text text-center">Things to improve based on our testing was adding our social media contact information and making sure the website is mobile friendly. Next to this, the users recommended to keep the lay-out and style. They really liked the colors and font of our website, but the font should also work for people who have not installed the adobe font. The testers could relate to our brand and liked the various visuals on the site. For the future, they recommended to add a price list and maybe some customer reviews. This could be done later once the company already has a bit of success.  </p>
