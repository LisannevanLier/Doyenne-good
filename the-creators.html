                Hi, I am Brenda, one of the four creators of Doyenne. As a young working woman, I have gone through many of the same experiences as you probably have, which is why empowering other women is so important to me. I want all working women to believe in their own abilities, so they will have a good experience in the work field.

                <p>
                    Hello dear, I am Ralitsa, an ambitious woman with optimistic nature. As an international and hardworking young lady, who has gone through many difficulties, I realized that every woman needs support, confidence and encouragement in the business world. We created Doyenne with one aim, to help all  women  reach their potential  by believing that they are capable of doing so!
